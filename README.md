# CancerDetection Using Logistic Regression

# Project Overview
This project involves using logistic regression for binary classification of medical data to detect cancer. The dataset includes features extracted from cell images, with labels indicating the presence or absence of cancer.

# Model Development
## - Data Preprocessing
- Checking for missing data if existed
- Checking for feature scaling if needed
- Splitting the data for training and testing sets

## - Model Implementation
- Built logistic regression models using scikit-learn.
- Explored hyperparameter tuning and regularization.
  
## - Evaluation:
- Used metrics like accuracy to evaluate the model.
